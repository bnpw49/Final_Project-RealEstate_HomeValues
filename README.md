## Problem
The US is one of the most expensive places to live in the world. It can be challenging for renters and home buyers to determine if they are paying a fair price for their rental or home. 


## Solution
Build a machine learning model to predict rental prices and housing costs for different types of properties in various neighborhoods in the US. The model could take into account various features, such as: number of career opportunities in each state, house hold income, is cheaper to rent vs buy, which month is better to buy/rent, rate of increase.
