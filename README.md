## Problem
The US is one of the most expensive places to live in the world. It can be challenging for renters and home buyers to determine if they are paying a fair price for their rental or home. 


## Solution
Build a machine learning model to predict rental prices and housing costs for different types of properties in various neighborhoods in the US. The model could take into account various features, such as: number of career opportunities in each state, house hold income, is cheaper to rent vs buy, which month is better to buy/rent, rate of increase. 

Visualizing through tableau, we can contextualize the data based on the observed trends against the macreconomic factors to formualate recommendations for interested property owners.

Initial indicator shows that cities in California with the highest rent is mostly centered in southern California in the Los Angeles area. Areas closer to the beach naturally have a higher price point that those farther inland. For example, Malibu had the fastest rate of growth at 19% in 2021 and 14% in 2022. Interestingly, this was during the onset of COVID. Coupled with quarantine and close to historically low interest rates, "properties that sometimes took years to attract buyers are now selling in months." (Forbes). This economic factor can also be a driving factor for why the cities experienced their respective highest rates of growth in 2022. For renters looking to live in California, this suggest areas away from the coast would eb more affordable. On the contrary, for owners who are looking to rent, they can capitolize on this opportunity to open their houses to services such as Airbnb.

There is an observed increase in housing sales in 2021 and 2022 and a sharp decline in 2023. The organized data reflects the expected trend from the macroeconomic happenings during that time. In 2021, mortgage rates hit a historic 30-year low of 2.65%. This increase in demand will cause sales prices to increase alongside it. In fact, C.A.R (California Association of Realtors) anticipated that the median home price will increase by 5.2% in 2022 after demands of 2021, which we can see materializing here as the sale price continue to increase from the year before. Sale prices started to decline in 2023 as mortgage rates keep rising, with 6.43% the week ending April 27th. Rising cost of  inflation and unemployment contributes to the growing consumer uncertainty and potentially leading to  "the largest housing correction in the post WWII era" (Yahoo Finance). As interest rates continue to rise while the Fed is tackling inflation, potential homeowners should look to save their money to buy property once the maket cools off.
